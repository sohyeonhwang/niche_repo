This is a directory to keep track of supporting materials/information about the interview portion of this study. 

We conducted 20 interviews in 2 rounds. 

Interview transcripts and related materials are stored in a private, password-secured machine (kibo at Northwestern), not on the this repository. Do NOT store interview transcripts or audio or the direct interview materials (including IRB, protocols, etc.) on the Github repository. These should all be on kibo under Sohyeon's user directory.

Currently, this directory contains:

* `logs.txt` - which contains a log of work progress/updates as it pertains to the interviews. e.g., "P13-P15 transcripts cleaned."
